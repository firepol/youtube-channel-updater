# Cursor Rules for YouTube Channel Updater

## Project Context
- Main specs: `docs/specifications.md`
- Progress tracking: `docs/development-tracking.md`
- Implementation plan: `docs/plan.md` (to be created)

## Coding Standards
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Use YouTube Data API v3
- Follow error handling patterns from specs
- Implement logging as specified
- Use `ts-node` or `tsx` for running TypeScript scripts

## File Organization
- API integration in `src/api/`
- Configuration in `config/`
- Data storage in `data/`
- Scripts in `scripts/`

## Key Implementation Guidelines
- Always check API rate limits before making calls
- Use local database (`data/videos.json`) to avoid repeated API calls
- Implement retry logic with 3 attempts for non-rate-limit errors
- Log all errors to `logs/errors.log`
- Use verbosity control via `VERBOSE` environment variable
- Sanitize playlist names for file naming (spaces â†’ underscores)

## Sync Reminders
- Update `development-tracking.md` after each significative change
- Keep specs and implementation in sync
- Document API rate limit considerations
- Test with small datasets first
