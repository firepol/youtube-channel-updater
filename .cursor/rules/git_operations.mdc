# Git Operations Rules

## Automatic Commit Workflow
- **ALWAYS commit automatically after completing any code change, fix, or feature**
- **DO NOT wait for user to request commits** - take initiative to commit after each working change
- Before committing any changes:
  1. Always run `git status` to check for all modified files
  2. Review the list of modified files to ensure all related changes are included
  3. Stage all related files together using `git add`
  4. Verify the staged changes with `git status` again
  5. Commit with an appropriate message following the commit message rules

## Commit Message Format
- Use conventional commit format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Keep the first line under 80 characters
- Write descriptive but concise messages - avoid listing specific file names
- Focus on what was accomplished rather than which files were changed
- Example: `refactor(rules): consolidate cursor rules and add automatic commit workflow`
- **Always stage and commit all files related to a change together** including:
  - Source files (e.g., components, pages, utils)
  - Entry points (e.g., App.tsx, main.tsx)
  - Configuration files (e.g., vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts)
  - Test files
  - When dependencies are added/removed, always include both `package.json` and `yarn.lock`

## Git Workflow Guidelines
- When making changes that affect multiple files:
  - Check `git status` before and after making changes
  - Ensure all related files are staged together
  - Do not commit partial changes that are logically related
- When working with dependencies:
  - Always check `git status` to ensure both `package.json` and lock files are included
  - Verify that no unintended files are staged
- When fixing issues or implementing features:
  - Check `git status` to identify all affected files
  - Include all related configuration, test, and documentation changes in the same commit

## Amending Git History
- When amending git history (e.g., fixing commit messages or squashing commits):
  - **NEVER use interactive git commands** (such as `git commit --amend` without `--no-edit`, or any command that opens an editor or requires user input)
  - **ALWAYS use non-interactive, scriptable commands**
    - Preferred: `git reset --soft HEAD~N` to move N commits back to the staging area, then re-commit with the correct message(s)
  - Ensure the workflow is fully automated and does not require user input

  - Verify that no unintended files are staged
- When fixing issues or implementing features:
  - Check `git status` to identify all affected files
  - Include all related configuration, test, and documentation changes in the same commit
